The Hotel management System is a Database Management System (DBMS) mini-project designed to facilitate efficient booking and management of rooms in various
establishments such as hotels, conference centers, or educational institutions. This system incorporates both online and offline booking capabilities to cater to a diverse range of users.
The system consists of two main components: the user interface for booking rooms and an administrative panel for managing bookings, room availability, and user accounts. 
Users can access the system through a web-based interface or via an offline application, providing flexibility in booking options.
The Room Booking System is designed to streamline the booking process, enhance user experience, and improve operational efficiency for both administrators and users.
By offering both online and offline booking options, the system caters to a wide range of users with varying preferences and accessibility needs.
